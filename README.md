# Bike Shop Map

This project displays a google map with custom markers for any bike shops within visible range. Bike shops can be filtered by whether or not they are currently open, relative elevation to other visible bike shops, and Google customer rating. Additionally, text search will narrow results on bike shop name and address.

This project was developed in conjunction with the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree at [Udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).
